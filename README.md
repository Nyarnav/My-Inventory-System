Hi my name is Van Ryan Nahine, im currently grade 12 ICT/CSS right now.

Im using git at termux, and im trying my best to be familiar with it.

i want to share my small projects in here and people might want to test it out.

other people can also use the code too.

I'm also a self taught programmer, im currently advance studying to compete in the tech industry, and im eager to learn more about technologies and programming stuff.

if you want to try my inventory system in your IDE, first edit the cmake if you know how to. The IDE i used is Cxxdroid from playstore and it automatically creates a cmake for you, i dont even know how it works but I will learn it soon.
